With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate. The PhD candidate should have a background in physics, physical chemistry/chemical physics or materials science. He/she should also have some experience in scientific programming and a background in statistical mechanics (including if possible Monte Carlo or/and Molecular Dynamics).\nPractical aspects.

Copper alloys are made of a copper matrix and a combination of single alloying elements in n-ary forms.  Due to the coexistence of different types of phases in this matrix, complex regions exist for which information on their precise atomistic structure is missing. In order to uncover such information, we apply active learning  and generate moment tensor potentials. This development is based on quantum-mechanical calculations. This approach allows the on-the-fly relaxation of many thousands of potentially novel candidates and check their stability. The ground-state energy of these structures is used to build active learning-generated convex hulls, which are in turn being compared to those from the simulations and the AFLOW database. This procedure provides an insight to additional new stable copper alloy relevant binary complexes. Here, in view of  Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, the  binary complexes Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Si, Cr-Ni, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Cr have been investigated. Their stability and the identification of novel stable candidates are discussed based on energetic arguments and the analysis of the respective phonon dispersion. The pipeline followed in this work is able to successfully predict binary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, specifically for the Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Ni and Cu-Ni complexes, and to extend the already reported structures in the AFLOW library. In the end, we show the applicability of a predicted Cu-Si stable phase and the developed machine learned potentials at the larger scale of atomistic simulations for the calculation of their mechanical properties and melting behavior. This work provides a computationally efficient framework for material structure prediction and calculation of their properties at a quantum-mechanical accuracy.

The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.","tags":null,"title":"Transport of thin water films: from thermally activated random walks to hydrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616716800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616716800,"objectID":"c9b43379e5a74a23273e30f0fd14b978","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2021-violations-of-jeffery.html","publishdate":"2021-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2021-violations-of-jeffery.html","section":"publication","summary":"Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate the shear-induced rotational dynamics of a Brownian nanographene (hexabenzocoronene) freely suspended in a liquid. We demonstrate that, owing to a finite hydrodynamic slip at the molecular surface, these flat molecules tend to align with a constant orientation angle instead of performing the classical periodic orbits predicted by Jeffery's theory. Results are extracted for different Péclet numbers and compared to the predictions by a theory developed for a rigid axisymmetric particle with orientation confined to the flow-gradient plane. The theory is based on the resolution of a one-dimensional Fokker-Planck equation for the angle φ made by one of the particle's diameters with the flow direction. Remarkably, our results show that the essential features of the three-dimensional orientational statistics of the nanographene are captured by the one-dimensional model, given that the hydrodynamic velocity is closed in terms of the slip length λ. Finally, we explore the situation in which multiple nanographenes are suspended in the liquid, and show that slip results in a reduction in specific viscosity.","tags":null,"title":"Violations of Jeffery's theory in the dynamics of nanographene in shear flow","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Pascal Raux","**Simon Gravelle**","Jacques Dumais"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1579478400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1579478400,"objectID":"06a6b0593fbff727788d83e679c6d1f4","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2020-design-of-a-unidirectional.html","publishdate":"2020-01-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020-design-of-a-unidirectional.html","section":"publication","summary":"The bromeliad Tillandsia landbeckii thrives in the Atacama desert of Chile using the fog captured by specialized leaf trichomes to satisfy its water needs. However, it is still unclear how the trichome of T. landbeckii and other Tillandsia species is able to absorb fine water droplets during intermittent fog events while also preventing evaporation when the plant is exposed to the desert’s hyperarid conditions. Here, we explain how a 5800-fold asymmetry in water conductance arises from a clever juxtaposition of a thick hygroscopic wall and a semipermeable membrane. While absorption is achieved by osmosis of liquid water, evaporation under dry external conditions shifts the liquid-gas interface forcing water to diffuse through the thick trichome wall in the vapor phase. We confirm this mechanism by fabricating artificial composite membranes mimicking the trichome structure. The reliance on intrinsic material properties instead of moving parts makes the trichome a promising basis for the development of microfluidics valves.","tags":null,"title":"Design of a unidirectional water valve in Tillandsia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Christophe Ybert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577404800,"objectID":"a21fb854e4f6fa2120e0dcc5ceb8f248","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2019-flow-induced.html","publishdate":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-flow-induced.html","section":"publication","summary":"Despite mass flow being arguably the most elementary transport associated with nanofluidics, its measurement still constitutes a significant bottleneck for the development of this promising field.

Combining theoretical and numerical calculations beyond the classical 1D treatment of nanochannels, we rationalize quantitatively our observations and demonstrate unprecedented flow rate sensitivity.
