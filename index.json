With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate. The PhD candidate should have a background in physics, physical chemistry/chemical physics or materials science. He/she should also have some experience in scientific programming and a background in statistical mechanics (including if possible Monte Carlo or/and Molecular Dynamics).\nPractical aspects. The position is available starting January 2024 and lasts for 36 months. The PhD student will work under the supervision of Benoit Coasne/Simon Gravelle (LIPhy, Grenoble) and Yann Magnin (CSTJF, Pau).

In this chapter, I explore the potential for foreign direct investment (FDI) to contribute to intrastate conflicts in developing countries, shedding light on the often-overlooked negative impact of foreign capital. Utilizing mixed methods, I analyze the impact of different types of FDI on the legalization of human rights laws prohibiting torture and other forms of political violence. Specifically, I focus on the impact different sectoral investments from foreign countries have on the process, as well as the impact of divergent weights of investment in each sector. I argue that foreign investment has heterogeneous effects across sectors on social conflicts in Africa. I rely on social conflict partially as a proxy for the strength of the legalization of human rights laws prohibiting government use of excessive force. Based on data in fDi Markets and the Armed Conflict, Location, and Event Project (ACLED) from 2013 to 2019, I use a difference-in-difference method, with net flows of foreign investment in each interested year by sector and lagged social conflicts, to study the causal relationship between FDI and the likelihood of inciting social conflicts in Africa.  I compare Chinese oil investment in Sudan with Chinese construction and manufacturing investment in Ethiopia. Overall, the results demonstrate that investment toward “inclusive” sectors, including the manufacturing, construction, and service sectors, mitigate host countries’ social conflicts: such investment has positive spillover effects for the strength of civil society, local empowerment and provides long-term public welfare for local workers. By contrast, investment in “extractive” sectors, including the oil and mining sectors, intensifies host countries’ social conflicts, including wealth inequalities, corruption, and absences of government accountability to the public. There are a number of implications this study has for foreign investors, including proper timing for market entry, readjustment, and even withdrawal for MNCs. Moreover, investment managers do more to learn about the impacts of resource allocation across various sectors in society. Greater knowledge of local power structures and extant relations between non-governmental and governmental sectors in a country holds promise as a way of lessening the negative unintended consequences of FDI on social stability.","tags":null,"title":"When Do Foreign Investment Fuel Social Conflicts in Africa?","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Update will be posted here.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"006f6f30ba9f03341dfbc41d9d1dd847","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","section":"project","summary":"Ongoing MSCA project","tags":["Nanofluids"],"title":"Hybrid nanoporous materials for the separation of fluid mixtures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Tests\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60e79cb28829481c20d3db0f4695ad7c","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/blog/about-me.html","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me.html","section":"blog","summary":"Details.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"}]
