With the goal to reach carbon neutrality by 2050, direct air capture (DAC) of CO2 from wet flue gases is one brick of the carbon mitigation strategy – especially with the next generation of solid porous sorbents based on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOF). While thermodynamics of the CO2 capture is well documented in the literature, little is known about molecular diffusion and transport properties in MOF angstropores (in particular, in the presence of environmental humidity). Also, diffusion through pore scales of the applicative sorbing medium, ranging from nanopores (pore diameter ~nm) to macropores (\u0026gt; 50 nm) and beyond remain open. In order to fill the gap and gain insight into multiscale transport properties and try to figure CO2 capture optimization through MOF based sorbents, we ambition to develop a multiscale approach based on a lattice model fed by molecular simulations.\nIn more detail, the objective of this PhD proposal is two-fold. i. Using molecular simulations [e.g. Magnin et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2022], we aim to unravel the molecular phenomena that govern the thermodynamic and kinetic mechanisms when capturing CO2 using a multi-scale porous material. With this first aspect, we aim to rationalize the use of nanoporous materials for practical engineering processes by developing a robust and general methodology to link physico-chemical properties at different scales. ii. Using a bottom-up strategy, we will upscale the results obtained using atomistic simulations to mimic phase separation and transport of CO2/N2/H2O mixtures at the macroscale. To do so, a simple yet realistic lattice model [Botan et al. Phys. Rev. E 2015], which can be seen as a pore network model accounting for the change of the local thermodynamic/transport properties in a kinetic engineering process (e.g. Pressure Swing Adsorption), will be used.\nPotential candidate.

All-atom (AA) resolved simulations are typically employed to gain further microscopic insights while reproducing the relaxation rates R1. However, such approaches are limited to time and length-scales that hinder modeling of systems like long polymer chains or hydrogels. Coarse-graining (CG) can overcome this barrier at the cost of loosing atomistic details that impede the calculation of NMR relaxation rates. Here, we address this issue by systematic characterization of dipolar relaxation rates R1 while performing systematic measurements on a PEG-H2O mixture at two different levels of details: AA and CG. Remarkably, we show that NMR relaxation rates R1 obtained at the CG level obey the same trends when compared to AA calculations, but with a systematic offset. This offset is due to, on the one hand, the lack of an intra-monomer component and, on the other hand, the inexact positioning of the spin carriers. We show that the offset can be corrected for quantitatively by reconstructing a posteriori the atomistic details for the CG trajectories.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the validity of NMR relaxation rates obtained from coarse-grained simulations of PEG-water mixtures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ángel Díaz Carral","Xiang Xu","**Simon Gravelle**","Azade Yazdan Yar","Siegfried Schmauder","Maria Fyta"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1686700800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1686700800,"objectID":"f7c6b3c3701b473915b1a423752df30a","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2023-stability-of-binary.html","publishdate":"2023-06-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2023-stability-of-binary.html","section":"publication","summary":"Binary complexes that can be found in copper alloys are investigated in this work through a combination of computer simulations and machine learning. Copper alloys are made of a copper matrix and a combination of single alloying elements in n-ary forms.  Due to the coexistence of different types of phases in this matrix, complex regions exist for which information on their precise atomistic structure is missing. In order to uncover such information, we apply active learning  and generate moment tensor potentials. This development is based on quantum-mechanical calculations. This approach allows the on-the-fly relaxation of many thousands of potentially novel candidates and check their stability. The ground-state energy of these structures is used to build active learning-generated convex hulls, which are in turn being compared to those from the simulations and the AFLOW database. This procedure provides an insight to additional new stable copper alloy relevant binary complexes. Here, in view of  Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, the  binary complexes Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Si, Cr-Ni, Cu-Ni, and Cu-Cr have been investigated. Their stability and the identification of novel stable candidates are discussed based on energetic arguments and the analysis of the respective phonon dispersion. The pipeline followed in this work is able to successfully predict binary phases in Cu-Ni-Si-Cr alloys, specifically for the Cu-Si, Ni-Si, Cr-Ni and Cu-Ni complexes, and to extend the already reported structures in the AFLOW library. In the end, we show the applicability of a predicted Cu-Si stable phase and the developed machine learned potentials at the larger scale of atomistic simulations for the calculation of their mechanical properties and melting behavior.

Here, we use nuclear magnetic relaxation dispersion measurements to better understand the dynamic properties of water within two types of salt crusts: sodium chloride (NaCl) and sodium sulfate (Na2SO4 ). Our experimental results display a stronger dispersion of the relaxation time T1 with frequency for the case of Na2SO4 as compared to NaCl salt crusts. To gain insight into these results, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of salt solutions confined within slit nanopores made of either NaCl or Na2SO4 . We find a strong dependence of the value of the relaxation time T1 on pore size and salt concentration. Our simulations reveal the complex interplay between the adsorption of ions at the solid surface, the structure of water near the interface, and the dispersion of T1 at low frequency, which we attribute to adsorption-desorption events.","tags":null,"title":"NMR Investigation of Water in Salt Crusts: Insights from Experiments and Molecular Simulations","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorial has just been published, and offers:\na new structure with a sphinx template tutorials are now written in rst format, instead of html, which should facilitate future collaborations a gorgeous dark mode (for the tutorials, not yet for the index page) The version 1.0 is still visible here, but is not maintained and some commands are likely to be obsolete.\n","date":1675555200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675555200,"objectID":"ee15b0519ba5c1c945f26268fe2520de","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","publishdate":"2023-02-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-lammpstutorial-v2.0.html","section":"news","summary":"Now with a new structure and a dark mode!","tags":["Outreach"],"title":"The version 2.0 of LAMMPS tutorials has been released","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"After 2 great years at the ICP in Stuttgart, I am starting my own MSCA project (NanoSep) at LIPhy (UGA) in Benoit Coasne group.\n","date":1675123200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675123200,"objectID":"66dd1b146c89edb888469dc3743a0900","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/news/2023-liphy-arrival.html","publishdate":"2023-01-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/news/2023-liphy-arrival.html","section":"news","summary":"My goal is to evaluate the possibility of separating fluid mixtures using nanopores.","tags":["Personal"],"title":"New MSCA project NanoSep starting at UGA","type":"news"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The version 0.7 of MAICoS has been released.

The film thickness as well as its transport behavior sensitively depend on the surrounding humidity. Understanding this intricate interplay is of the highest relevance for water transport through porous media, particularly in the context of soil salinization induced by evaporation. Here, we use molecular simulations to evaluate the transport properties of thin water films on prototypical salt and soil interfaces, namely NaCl and silica solid surfaces. Our results show two distinct regimes for water transport: at low water coverage, the film permeance scales linearly with the adsorbed amount, in agreement with the activated random walk model. For thicker water films, the permeance scales as the adsorbed amount to the power of 3, in line with the Stokes equation. By comparing results obtained for silica and NaCl surfaces, we find that, at low water coverage, water permeance at the silica surface is considerably lower than at the NaCl surface, which we attribute to difference in hydrogen bonding. We also investigate the effect of atomic surface defects on the transport properties. Finally, in the context of water transport through the porous material, we determine the humidity-dependent crossover between a vapor-dominated and a thin film-dominated transport regimes depending on the pore size.","tags":null,"title":"Transport of thin water films: from thermally activated random walks to hydrodynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Adyant Agrawal","**Simon Gravelle**","Catherine Kamal","Lorenzo Botto"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651708800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651708800,"objectID":"d0401451a881c79dfebceae8fe530191","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","publishdate":"2022-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2022-viscous-peeling.html","section":"publication","summary":"Combining molecular dynamics (MD) and continuum simulations, we study the dynamics of propagation of a peeling front in a system composed of multilayered graphene nanosheets completely immersed in water.

Using MD, we compute the pulling force as a function of the pulling velocity, and quantify the viscous resistance to the advancement of the peeling front. We compare the MD results to a 1D continuum model of a sheet loaded with modelled hydrodynamic loads. Our results show that the viscous dependence of the force on the velocity is negligible below a threshold velocity. Above this threshold, the hydrodynamics is mainly controlled by the viscous resistance associated to the flow near the crack opening, while lubrication forces are negligible owing to the large hydrodynamic slip at the liquid-solid boundary. Two dissipative mechanisms are identified: a drag resistance to the upward motion of the edge, and a resistance to the gap opening associated to the curvature of the flow streamlines near the entrance.

Our results also show that the surface activity of the particle depends on the number of surface oxygen groups as well as on their distribution: for a given number of oxygen groups, a GO particle with a patched surface was found to be more surface active than a particle with evenly distributed groups. Then, to understand what sets the thickness of GO layers at interfaces, the adsorption energy of a test GO particle was measured in the presence of multiple GO particles already adsorbed at the interface.

In this article, by solving the Fokker–Plank equation for the orientation distribution function and corroborating the analysis with boundary integral simulations, we quantify a threshold Péclet number, Pec, above which such alignment occurs. We found that for Pe smaller than Pec, but larger than a second threshold, a regime emerges where Brownian fluctuations are strong enough to break the platelet's alignment and induce rotations, but with a period of rotation that depends on the value of λ. For Pe below this second threshold, slip has a negligible effect on the orientational dynamics. We use these thresholds to classify the dynamics of graphene-like nanoplatelets for realistic values of λ and apply our results to the quantification of the orientational contribution to the effective viscosity of a dilute suspension of nanoplatelets with slip.

We then scale up the atomic results using a lattice approach, and simulate the transport at the micrometric scale. Results obtained for a model Lennard-Jones fluid and TIP4P/2005 water were compared, allowing us to identify the key physical parameters for achieving a passive hydraulic valve. Our results show that the difference in transport properties of water vapor and liquid water within the cellulose layer is the basis for the ability of the Tillandsia trichome to function as a water valve. Finally, we predict a critical pore dimension above which the cellulose layer can form an efficient valve.","tags":null,"title":"A multi-scale model for fluid transport through a bio-inspired passive valve","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Simon Gravelle**","Christophe Ybert"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577404800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577404800,"objectID":"a21fb854e4f6fa2120e0dcc5ceb8f248","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/publication/2019-flow-induced.html","publishdate":"2019-12-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-flow-induced.html","section":"publication","summary":"Despite mass flow being arguably the most elementary transport associated with nanofluidics, its measurement still constitutes a significant bottleneck for the development of this promising field. Here, we investigate how a liquid flow perturbs the ubiquitous enrichment—or depletion—of a solute inside a single nanochannel. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy to access the local solute concentration, we demonstrate that the initial enrichment—the so-called Donnan equilibrium—is depleted under flow, thus revealing the underlying mass transport. Combining theoretical and numerical calculations beyond the classical 1D treatment of nanochannels, we rationalize quantitatively our observations and demonstrate unprecedented flow rate sensitivity. Because the present mass transport investigations are based on generic effects, we believe that they can develop into a versatile approach for nanofluidics.","tags":null,"title":"Flow-induced shift of the Donnan equilibrium for ultra-sensitive mass transport measurement through a single nanochannel","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Update will be posted here.\n","date":1461715200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461715200,"objectID":"006f6f30ba9f03341dfbc41d9d1dd847","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","publishdate":"2016-04-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/hybrid-nanoporous-materials.html","section":"project","summary":"Ongoing MSCA project","tags":["Nanofluids"],"title":"Hybrid nanoporous materials for the separation of fluid mixtures","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":[],"content":" Tests\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"60e79cb28829481c20d3db0f4695ad7c","permalink":"https://florenceyuelin.github.io/blog/about-me.html","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/about-me.html","section":"blog","summary":"Details.","tags":[],"title":"About Me","type":"blog"}]
