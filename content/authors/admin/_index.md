**About me**

Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student in the Travers Department of Political Science at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/), with a [Designated Emphasis](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/people/) on Political Economy. My main research interests cover international tension, multinational corporation, foreign lobbying, and computational social sciences. Currently, I work on a project that explores the interplay among home countries, host nations, and firms in an era marked by global economic and security interconnections. My research has received funding from [Berkeley Economy and Society Initiative](https://besi.berkeley.edu/) and [Network for a New Political Economy](https://n2pe.berkeley.edu/). 

Prior to doctoral studies, I gained experience at the [American Enterprise Institute](https://www.aei.org/), the [Center for Strategic and International Studies](https://www.csis.org/), and the [Institute of New Structural Economics](https://www.nse.pku.edu.cn/en/) at [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/). I earned my first M.A. in International Economics and International Relations (with an area concentration of China) from Johns Hopkins University, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies, second M.A. in Political Science from UC Berkeley, and Bachelor of Social Sciences in Government and International Relations from Hong Kong Baptist University, United International College.
